Title: participants

# Research Participant Information
The Brain Development Laboratory is interested in how the visual system develops over time. To reach this goal, we use behavoral, EEG and MRI techniques to study how the infant, child and adult brain responds to  motion and pattern. 

## EEG Studies
EEG (Electroencephalogram) is a technique which allows the electrical signals in the brain to be recorded. In these studies we are recording the brain activity while the participants watch images on a computer monitor. The studies at our lab take approximately 1 hour. We are currently looking for infants (3-7 months) to participate as child scientists. To learn more about how to get involved, please choose the appropriate study below:

## Behavioral Studies
### Symmetry Sorting Study  
We are studying how the brain perceives symmetry in two-dimensions. Participants view a series of images and group them into similar categories.
   
- We do not have an active study at this time.

### Detection of Optic Flow
In this study, participants view two images side by side on a computer screen and have to choose which one has coherent motion. We are currently looking for children to participate as child scientists.

## MRI Studies
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) provides information about blood flow in the brain. This technique allows us to determine the areas of the brain that are active while viewing a particular stimuli.  

- We do not have an active study at this time.
