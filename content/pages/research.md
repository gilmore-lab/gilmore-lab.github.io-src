## Developmental Dynamics of Optic Flow Processing

![Brain activity]({filename}/images/fesi-2014.jpg) ![Optic flow]({filename}/images/optic-flow.jpg)

Visual motion provides humans and animals with information about their own movement through 3D space and about the structure of the environment -- the objects, surfaces, and other animals that it may contain. How the human brain processes complex motion information poses an as-yet unanswered question. This project focuses on characterizing how sensitivity to visual motion emerges in the developing human brain: how brain (EEG) responses to patterns of ego- and object motion emerge, how they develop from infancy through childhood into adulthood, how specific changes in cortical circuitry might account for the observed patterns, and how behavioral sensitivity to motion corresponds to neural activation. The studies compare brain responses and behavioral discrimination patterns in infants, children, and adults to the same types of ego- and object motion. The studies also involve an effort to measure or simulate the statistics of optic flow experienced by infant, child, and adult observers in complex, natural environments using computer vision methods.

## Computational Symmetry

![Symmetric image]({filename}/images/symmetry-sample-1.png) ![Symmetric image]({filename}/images/symmetry-sample-2.png)

The ability to sense regular or near-regular patterns serves critical biological needs and is equally important for computer vision and machine intelligence. Despite wide variation in the types of regularity present in natural images, research on human and computer processing of pattern regularity has focused primarily on detecting bilateral reflection symmetry, using largely atheoretical approaches. The goals of this interdisciplinary research are to i) use principles of group theory to develop a conceptual framework for understanding regularity perception and brain activation in humans, and ii) to design general computer-based symmetry detection algorithms that can operate at a level of practical usability.

The [Databrary Project ](http://databrary.org) aims to increase scientific transparency and accelerate discovery in developmental science by building the infrastructure for researchers to share video data and related meta-data. The project has five specific aims:

- Create a web-based [data library](http://databrary.org) for sharing and preserving video data and associated meta-data.
- Create participant and contributor/user standards that enable open sharing of video data while limiting access to authorized users to ensure participant confidentiality.
- Expand the free, open source video coding software, [Datavyu](http://datavyu.org) to enable coding, exploring, and analyzing video data.
- Build a data management system to support data sharing within labs, among collaborators, and in the Databrary repository.
- Transform the culture of developmental science by building a community of researchers committed to open video data sharing.

Databrary is an [open-source](http://github.com/databrary) software project. Penn State is one of the major "nodes", with a large number of authorized users.

## The Proximal Emotional Environment Project (PEEP)

A 5-year-old overhears her parents arguing loudly in the next room. She may not understand why they are arguing, but she realizes something is wrong because she perceives anger in their voices. Exposure to interpersonal conflict is consistently associated with less skillful emotion regulation in children although the mechanisms remain to be explained. Because inter-personal conflict is a heterogeneous phenomenon, investigation of the specific features of conflict that contribute to developmental pathways to emotional dysfunction and symptoms requires a process-oriented approach. In this project, we focus on brain responses to angry prosody in natural speech. We are studying young children’s neural processing of angry prosody, spoken by mothers and strangers, as a first step toward a future longitudinal study investigating how the neurocognitive processing of angry prosody mediates relations between conflict exposure in children and the development of anxiety- and anger-related symptoms.
